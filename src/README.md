The .json files directly under src/ are files which are shared between all technologies; PHP, Stylus & JavaScript.

## breakpoints.json
Used to generate media queries in Stylus. Can be used in JS as well by importing the file and utilizing window.matchMedia.

## schemes.json
Used to create (colour) schemes to the theme. Each scheme becomes available for selection in custom Gutenberg blocks, and CSS classes are autogenerated for them.

I tried populating the values with colours.json without much success; you have to use colour codes instead of colour names.

## colours.json
Used to define available colours for the project. This file should contain all colours that you intend to use in schemes.
