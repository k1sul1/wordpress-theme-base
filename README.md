# k1sul1/wordpress-theme-base

My idea of the perfect starting point for WordPress themes. Modern tooling in the frontend and utilities to keep you from repeating yourself.

I've shipped dozens of custom made WordPress sites and made a few of these starting points. Mistakes have been made, but everything in here has been battletested in production.

See also: [k1sul1/docker-wordpress-spa-template](https://github.com/k1sul1/docker-wordpress-cra-spa-template) for a local / production Docker environment with Let's Encrypt. It's built for single page applications but can be dumbed down by removing irrelevant services and configuration pieces.

WIP

## Install

```
composer require k1sul1/wordpress-theme-base
```

You might have to add dev-master as version until I create a release.
